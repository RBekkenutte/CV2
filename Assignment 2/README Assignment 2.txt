In eight-point-alg.py all the code that is used for this assignment is written. We have used keypoint_matching from CV1 to accompany the algorithms for this assignment. 

All our results can be reproduced by running the eight-point-alg.py file.

By default, the dense_matrix_with_threshold1 PVM will be loaded and the 3D point cloud for the first dense block will be visualized. 

By changing some comments in the make_epipolar() function and by uncommenting the function, the epipolar lines can be visualized for a pair of images, by default, images 1 and 20.
